```

To run a specific task type `task` followed by the task name, e.g.:

```sh
docker compose exec jobs task download-object-items
```

If the task is already up to date, it will not run. To force a task to run, type the command followed by `--force`

```sh
docker compose exec jobs task download-object-items --force
```

To add additional arguments to the task itself, enter the arguments after a `--` sign, e.g.:

```sh
docker compose exec jobs task download-object-items -- --limit 100
```
